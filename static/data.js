                text: "A man found a cocoon of a butterfly. One day a small opening appeared. He sat and watched the butterfly for several hours as it struggled to squeeze its body through the tiny hole. Then it stopped, as if it couldn't go further. So the man decided to help the butterfly. He took a pair of scissors and snipped off the remaining bits of cocoon. The butterfly emerged easily but it had a swollen body and shriveled wings. The man continued to watch it, expecting that any minute the wings would enlarge and expand enough to support the body. Neither happened! In fact the butterfly spent the rest of its life crawling around. It was never able to fly. What the man in his kindness and haste did not understand: The restricting cocoon and the struggle required by the butterfly to get through the opening was a way of forcing the fluid from the body into the wings so that it would be ready for flight once that was achieved. Sometimes struggles are exactly what we need in our lives. Going through life with no obstacles would cripple us. We will not be as strong as we could have been and we would never fly."

                text: "Two seeds lay side by side in the fertile soil. The first seed said, 'I want to grow! I want to send my roots deep into the soil beneath me, and thrust my sprouts through the earth's crust above me... I want to unfurl my tender buds like banners to announce the arrival of spring... I want to feel the warmth of the sun on my face and the blessing of the morning dew on my petals!' And so she grew. The second seed said, 'I am afraid. If I send my roots into the ground below, I don't know what I will encounter in the dark. If I push my way through the hard soil above me I may damage my delicate sprouts... What if I let my buds open and a snail tries to eat them? And if I were to open my blossoms, a small child may pull me from the ground. No, it is much better for me to wait until it is safe.' And so she waited. A yard hen scratching around in the early spring ground for food found the waiting seed and promptly ate it."

                text: "A university professor went to visit a famous Zen master. While the master quietly served tea, the professor talked about Zen. The master poured the visitor's cup to the brim, and then kept pouring. The professor watched the overflow until he could no longer restrain himself. 'It's overfull! No more will go in!' the professor burst out. 'You are like this cup,' the master replied, 'How can I show you Zen unless you first empty your cup?' This simple story reminds us to approach each moment with an open mind, free from preconceptions."

Then he saw two mice gnawing at the vine. At that moment, he spotted a wild strawberry growing from the cliff face. He plucked it and ate it. It was the sweetest strawberry he had ever tasted. This story teaches us to appreciate the present moment, even in difficult circumstances."

                text: "An elderly Chinese woman had two large pots, each hung on the ends of a pole which she carried across her neck. One of the pots had a crack in it while the other pot was perfect and always delivered a full portion of water. At the end of the long walk from the stream to the house, the cracked pot arrived only half full. For a full two years this went on daily, with the woman bringing home only one and a half pots of water. The perfect pot was proud of its accomplishments, but the poor cracked pot was ashamed of its own imperfection. One day by the stream, the cracked pot apologized to the woman: 'I am ashamed of myself because this crack in my side causes water to leak out all the way back to your house.' The old woman smiled, 'Did you notice that there are flowers on your side of the path, but not on the other pot's side? That's because I have always known about your flaw, so I planted flower seeds on your side of the path. Every day while we walk back, you water them. For two years I have been able to pick these beautiful flowers to decorate the table. Without you being just the way you are, there would not be this beauty to grace the house.'"

                text: "In a vast forest stood a unique tree known for its healing properties. People would travel from far and wide to sit beneath its branches, sharing their worries and sorrows. As they spoke, the tree's leaves would gently rustle, and somehow, their burdens felt lighter. Scientists later discovered that the tree released special compounds that helped reduce stress and anxiety. But the locals knew that the real healing came from the act of acknowledging their feelings and sharing their stories. The tree provided a safe space where people could be vulnerable and find strength in their vulnerability."
